# Account & Access

## Getting an Account

If you are interested in trying out the testbed you can contact us via mail: <testbed@nes-lab.org>.
We will provide you an access-token in time.
You have the option to not have your e-mail address stored on the testbed-server.

```{note}
1) While optional, an e-mail address on the server is needed for sending you updates on i.e. finished experiments.
2) To comply with [privacy law](/about/privacy.md) we will disable accounts that have been inactive for 6 month and delete the account in the following clean-up-cycle, no later than 12 months after deactivation.
3) The testbed is a best-effort service. Availability and functionality [is not guaranteed](/about/disclaimer.md).
```

## Access via Token

To access the testbed with your token you just add it to your config:
