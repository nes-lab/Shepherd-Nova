# Account & Access

## Getting an Account

It is currently not possible to create an account by yourself.
If you are interested in trying out the testbed you can [contact our group via mail](https://nes-lab.org/ingmar-splitt/).
We will provide you an access-token in time.
You have the option to not have your E-Mail Address stored on the testbed-server.
Please note, that this is needed for sending you updates on i.e. finished experiments.

## Access via Token

To access the testbed with your token you just add it to your config:

```{caution}
