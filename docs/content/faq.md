## Maintenance

For validating and updating the infrastructure a fixed timeslot is reserved every week, monday 8 PM CET, for 4 hours.
If needed, the scheduler will be paused during that time period.
Changes in the deployment will be announced in the [news-section](./news) ahead of time.

If critical work has to be done, we reserve the right to cancel currently active experiments at any time.

## Contributions

Feedback is more than welcome during that initial phase. Also welcome are reusable & useful scripts or firmware you developed and want to donate.
