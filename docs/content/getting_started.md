# Getting started

The testbed can be used via the [public web-API](./webapi).
For easier access we provide a testbed-client and additional tooling written in Python.
This section will describe a typical workflow.

```{note}
If you have trouble recreating a setup please don't hesitate [contacting](/about/contact.md) us.
We are also thankful for [bugreports](https://github.com/orgua/shepherd/issues).
```

## Installing the Tools

The tooling for the testbed is bundled in a package called `shepherd-data`.
Sources are [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/orgua/shepherd-datalib) and the package is [distributed via PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/shepherd-data/).

[![PyPiVersion](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/shepherd_data.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/shepherd_data)
[![image](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/shepherd_data.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/shepherd-data)

It contains

- the testbed-client,
- data-models for configuring an experiment,
- various functionality for analyzing the resulting hdf5-files
- a command-line interface and
- much more (out of scope for this guide)

You can install the tools by using the package-manager of your choice.
In this case we use pip:

```Shell
pip3 install shepherd-data -U
```
