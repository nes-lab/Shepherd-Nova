# Virtual Power Source

Detailed documentation will follow - for now the presets can be found in these fixtures:

- [VSrc-Fixture](https://github.com/nes-lab/shepherd-tools/blob/main/shepherd_core/shepherd_core/data_models/content/virtual_source_fixture.yaml)
- [VHrv-Fixture](https://github.com/nes-lab/shepherd-tools/blob/main/shepherd_core/shepherd_core/data_models/content/virtual_harvester_fixture.yaml)

```{seealso}
1) The latest documentation of the virtual power source can be found in the [main repo](https://nes-lab.github.io/shepherd/user/virtual_source.html).
2) Python-Ports of the virtual source and harvester can be found in the [core-lib](https://github.com/nes-lab/shepherd-tools/tree/main/shepherd_core/shepherd_core/vsource).
3) Examples for simulation of these ports ([VSrc](https://github.com/nes-lab/shepherd-tools/blob/main/shepherd_core/examples/simulate_vsource.py), [VHrv](https://github.com/nes-lab/shepherd-tools/blob/main/shepherd_core/examples/simulate_vharvester.py)) can also be found in the core-lib.
4) Characteristics of the BQ-ICs and other setups were derived from a [set of experiments](https://github.com/orgua/bq_characteristics).

```{attention}
TODO:
- port over <https://nes-lab.github.io/shepherd/user/virtual_source.html>
- show config of vsrc & vhrv
- how to define your own
- how to simulate
```
