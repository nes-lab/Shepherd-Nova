# Web-API

```{attention}
WORK IN PROGRESS, maybe move to FAQ and keep it short. It might be more helpful to introduce the targets instead.
```

The API is based on [fastapi](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi) and documents itself.
The included redoc-website is interactive.
It allows to log in and interact with actual data.
